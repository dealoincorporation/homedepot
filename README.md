- Add loading states for async operations
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- Keep components small and focused
- Use the established design system

## 🌐 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Connect Repository**
   - Import project on Vercel
   - Connect GitHub repository

2. **Configure Build Settings**
   ```json
   {
     "buildCommand": "npm run build",
     "outputDirectory": ".next",
     "installCommand": "npm install"
   }
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   - Automatic deployments on push to main
   - Preview deployments for pull requests

### Other Platforms

The app can be deployed to any platform supporting Node.js:
- Netlify
- AWS Amplify
- Digital Ocean App Platform

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Vercel Deployment

### Error: "Function Runtimes must have a valid version"

If you encounter this error during Vercel deployment:

```
Error: Function Runtimes must have a valid version, for example `now-php@1.0.0`.
```

**This error is caused by legacy runtime configuration in your Vercel project settings, not your code.**

#### Fix Steps:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Navigate to your project: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your `homedepot` project

2. **Open Project Settings**
   - Click on **Settings** tab
   - Look for **"Functions"** section in the left sidebar

3. **Remove Legacy Runtime Configuration**
   - In the **Functions** section, look for any entries like:
     - `now-php`
     - `now-node` (without version)
     - Any custom runtime without a version number
   - **Delete or remove** any such entries
   - **Do NOT add any custom runtime** - let Vercel auto-detect Next.js

4. **Verify vercel.json**
   - Ensure your `vercel.json` only contains:
     ```json
     {
       "regions": ["iad1"]
     }
     ```
   - **Do NOT** add `"functions"` or `"runtime"` fields

5. **Redeploy**
   - After removing the legacy runtime, trigger a new deployment
   - The build should now succeed

#### Why This Happens:

This error occurs when Vercel detects a legacy "Function Runtime" configuration (from older Vercel deployments) that doesn't have a version specified. Next.js projects don't need custom runtime configuration - Vercel automatically detects and uses the correct Node.js runtime.

#### Verification:

After fixing, your build should show:
```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Generating static pages
✓ Build completed successfully
```

### Environment Variables Setup

Make sure to configure these environment variables in **Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables**:

**Required:**
- `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret key for JWT tokens
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - NextAuth secret (if using NextAuth)

**Optional (for file uploads):**
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` - Cloudinary cloud name
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` - Cloudinary API key
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` - Cloudinary API secret

**Note:** Without Cloudinary configured, resume uploads will fail in production. The upload API requires Cloudinary for production deployments on Vercel.
